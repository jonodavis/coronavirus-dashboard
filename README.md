  - Two options for containment - supression or mitigation
  - Supression - delay epidemic and herd immunity by enforcing strong controls (lowest death rate - huge economic impact)
  - Mitigation - acquire herd immunity as quickly as possible whilst not exceeding hospital capacity (higher death rate - lesser economic impact)
  - Supression is reliant on a cure or vaccine becoming available, whilst mitigation is not, however vaccine would still help if available before herd immunity kicks in
